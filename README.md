# tvandmoviemap

This is an interactive graph built with [cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) + preact that showcases the connections between movie/TV titles I've watched so far. 

Each node represents a TV/movie title. Each edge connecting two such nodes is made for a reason, which can be the similarity between those titles in terms of theme/concept, genre or even actors, director(s).
